# Update Implementation Tracking

Please update the IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md file with the current progress and todo status.

**Tasks to perform:**
1. Review the current todo list and mark completed items as done
2. Update the "Current Todo List (Active Session)" section with remaining work
3. Add any new todos that emerged during development 
4. Update the "Session Handoff Notes" with current pipeline status
5. Move completed Phase 3 items to the appropriate status
6. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp

**Guidelines:**
- Be specific about file locations and implementation details for each todo
- Include test commands and validation steps
- Note any new issues discovered or architectural decisions made
- Keep the handoff notes actionable for the next development session

Remember: This document should allow a "future you" to pick up exactly where you left off.
