# Implementation Progress Tracker

## Phase 1: Foundation  COMPLETED
**Goal**: Basic working pipeline with URL discovery and fetching

### Core Components Status:
-  **Project structure**: Complete with models/, pipeline/, storage/, utils/
-  **Basic models**: CrawlJob, Page, Analytics models implemented
-  **URL discovery stage**: URLDiscoveryStage and LinkDiscoveryStage working
-  **HTTP fetching stage**: HTTPFetcherStage with adaptive rate limiting
-  **Content extraction stage**: ContentExtractionStage with BeautifulSoup + html2text  
-  **Basic checkpointing**: Recovery system with state management
-  **CLI interface**: Modern click-based CLI with comprehensive commands

### Recent Improvements:
-  **DRY Refactoring**: Eliminated code duplication across the codebase
  - Centralized time handling through `utils.time`
  - Consolidated utilities in `utils.common` and `utils.errors`
  - Replaced argparse with modern click CLI interface
  - Standardized error handling patterns
-  **File-based Storage**: Simplified from SQLite to JSON for rapid development
-  **Code Quality**: Passes ruff linting, improved imports and organization

### Success Criteria:  MET
- Can crawl small university sites with full pipeline
- Generates basic metrics and subdomain analysis  
- Survives network interruptions with checkpointing
- Recovery system works from any failure point

## Phase 2: Intelligence = IN PROGRESS
**Goal**: Add advanced analysis and adaptive behavior

### Enhanced Components Status:
-  **Content extraction**: BeautifulSoup + html2text conversion working
- = **Analysis stage**: Contact extraction utilities added, stage needs implementation
-  **Adaptive rate limiting**: Dynamic delay adjustment and blocking detection
-  **Enhanced checkpointing**: Stage-level recovery system implemented

### Remaining Work:
- ó **Contact Analysis Stage**: Implement pipeline stage using existing utilities
  - Email extraction from page content
  - Social media handle detection
  - Department-level contact organization
- ó **URL Structure Analysis**: Categorize pages by type (academic, admin, etc.)
- ó **Asset Categorization**: Classify linked files and resources

### Progress Notes:
- Foundation utilities for contact extraction exist in `utils.common`
- Pipeline architecture supports adding new analysis stages
- Rate limiting system is robust with per-domain tracking

---

## Phase 3: Production Ready ó PENDING
**Goal**: Export system and production robustness

### Components Status:
-  **Basic Export system**: CSV/JSON exporters in storage/data_store.py
- ó **Advanced analytics**: Subdomain breakdowns partially implemented
-  **Error handling**: Centralized in utils/errors.py
-  **Configuration management**: Domain-specific settings working

### Remaining Work:
- ó **Enhanced Export Templates**: Business-focused report formats
- ó **Link Relationship Analysis**: Inter-page connection mapping  
- ó **Performance Optimization**: Large-scale crawling improvements
- ó **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time crawling status and metrics

## Development Decisions Made:

### Architecture Choices:
1. **File-based over SQLite**: Faster development iteration, simpler debugging
2. **Click over argparse**: Modern CLI with better UX and maintainability
3. **BeautifulSoup over Crawl4AI**: Simpler extraction, add Crawl4AI as fallback later
4. **Centralized utilities**: DRY principles with shared time, error, and common functions

### Next Priority Tasks:
1. **Contact Analysis Stage**: Complete the missing intelligence component
2. **URL Structure Analysis**: Add page categorization 
3. **Enhanced Export Reports**: Business intelligence focused outputs
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate with larger university sites

### Code Quality Status:
-  Linting: Passes ruff check cleanly
-   Type checking: Some mypy issues remain (non-blocking)
-  Test coverage: Unit tests for core components
-  Documentation: README and code documentation up to date

**Last Updated**: January 2025
**Current Focus**: Phase 2 - Intelligence components (Analysis Stage)
